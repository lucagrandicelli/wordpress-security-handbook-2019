# The Wordpress Security Handbook 2019

Wondering if WordPress is safe? **The answer is yes**.

WordPress uses the latest security technologies. Moreover, it is continuously updated with new versions, which often include several vulnerability patches. Finally, WordPress is monitored and run by a large community of developers to whom security is deeply at heart.

**So why a Security Handbook?**
Because the protection of your website should be a continuous activity, which implies, among other ones, creating barriers against aggressors, the failure prevention, monitoring of changes, opposition to malicious access and concealment of sensitive information.

[WordPress is used in more than 30% of websites](https://w3techs.com/technologies/history_overview/content_management/all/y): just because of this popularity it is a target of cyber criminals and also a platform in continuous development, open to changes and additions with third parts.
